## Assignment 3 - Using grid and stuff
#### Due: Monday July 15th by 10:10am

# NOT DONE!

### Overview

Read the following overview about CSS `Grid`: https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/ and apply that to the code we discussed in class from: http://terrywgriffin.com/lessons/lesson_11/. Instead of using the table to display the colors from our JSON object, use the lessons learned from the `Grid` tutorial to create a layout that displays the colors in something other than a table with one color per row. 

### Possibility

- Display your color data in the grid squares themselves like below:

- Notice that the text is light or dark depending on the color. I will post some help on how to check for that.
