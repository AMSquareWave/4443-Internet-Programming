## Php Basics - No really just the basics

#### Variables

Php doesn't require you to "declare" a variable, per se, well not in the way that `C` requires it.
You can, you just don't have to. So ... how does `Php` know what "type" of variable that your using?
It uses `dynamic typing`:

>A language has dynamic typing when it does not associate values strictly with a specific type, but it is designed to 
"decide" what the type of a value should be at runtime, based on how you are attempting to use it.
