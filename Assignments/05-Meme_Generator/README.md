### Overview

Using the existing code from the vagrant server I uploded onto slack. Also HERE. 

- Add a new project
- Add a task to an existing project
- Clock in / out to an existing task
- View a summary of your existing projects and times.


### Requirements

- Create a folder called `jobtracking` within your `Assignments` folder.
- Make sure all of your resources are downloaded to this folder.
- Use the following directory structure:

```
/jobtracking
    |
    /var/www/html/jobtracking
    |-- index.html
    |
    |-- css
    |    |-- bootstrap.min.css
    |    `-- some.main.css
    |-- js
    |    |-- bootstrap.min.js
    |    `-- jquery.min.js
    |
