## Assignment 1 - Setting up Git (using Github)
#### Due: Tuesday Jun 3rd by 12:20

#### What is Git?

>Git is a distributed revision control and source code management (SCM) system with an emphasis on speed,data integrity,and support for distributed, non-linear workflows. Git was initially designed and developed by Linus Torvalds for Linux kernel development in 2005, and has since become the most widely adopted version control system for software development.<br><br>
As with most other distributed revision control systems, and unlike most clientâ€“server systems, every Git working directory is a full-fledged repository with complete history and full version-tracking capabilities, independent of network access or a central server. Like the Linux kernel, Git is free software distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License  [[1]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_(software)).

#### Why github?

We will be using github this semester as a means of communicating, storing documents (assignments and programs), as well as 
a means to push files to your very own server! So, get started...

#### Create a Github account. 
- When you create a Github account, you must choose a `username`. 
- This is very important to remember, because you will email it to me in the next part of this assignment.
- Create a repository named `4443-Internet-Programming-yourname` replace the `yourname` with your first or last name to make it unique.
- Add me: `rugbyprof` as a collaborator to your repository. You can do this in the settings of your repository.

#### Send me an email:

- `To`: terry.griffin@mwsu.edu
- `Subject`: 4443 Internet Programming - Assignment 1
