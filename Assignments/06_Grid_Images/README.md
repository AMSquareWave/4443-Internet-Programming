## Assignment 6 - Using grid and stuff again
#### Due: Monday July 22<sup>nd</sup> by 10:10am

# NOT DONE !

### Overview

Remember your grid assignment from before? Rinse and repeat. There is a sample dataset in the [card_services](./card_services) folder, that holds fake student information and "M" numbers. It is called [student_data.json](./card_services/student_data.json) and it holds 1000 students. There is also a folder that holds 1000 student images called [photos](./card_services/photos). 

[HERE](./helper_code.php) is some php code that reads a directory and a json file.

### Possibility

- Originally we did this:

- Now I want to see this:

### Deliverables

- Make sure all files end up on your github repository as well as your server.
- If I ask you to name a file a certian way, I expect it to be named exactly as asked.
- Create a folder called `Assignments` in your github repo. All of your assigments will go in this folder when being pushed to github. 
- Due to the nature of this class you will have files in two places. So I would work on your server, then push the completed files to github when you are done.
- Create a folder called `assignment_03`. This will be located at `/var/www/html` and in your github assignments folder.
- I should be able to see your grid creation by going to: `http://your.ip.address/assignment_03`
- For now place any additional `CSS` or `javascript` directly in the `index.html` file and not as an external resource. 
- Remember to comment your code! In fact place comments around any additions you make to the `index` file.
